That sounds like a great way to showcase your skills in pandas and matplotlib! Focusing on left-footed players is an interesting way to create more specific insights. 
Below are 10 analysis questions you could answer regarding left-footed players in your dataset, along with some brief ideas for how to approach them

1. What is the age distribution of left-footed players?
Analysis: Create a histogram to see the age distribution of left-footed players.
Code Tip: Use df[df['foot'] == 'Left'] to filter for left-footed players, and then plot the distribution of their ages.

2. How does the market price compare for left-footed players across different positions?
Analysis: Compare the average prices of left-footed players based on their positions (e.g., forwards, midfielders, defenders).
Code Tip: Group the dataset by position and calculate the mean price for left-footed players.

3. What is the relationship between age and price for left-footed players?
Analysis: Plot a scatter plot to explore if there's any correlation between a playerâ€™s age and their price.
Code Tip: Use a scatter plot to visualize age vs. price for left-footed players, possibly adding a trend line with seaborn.regplot.

4. Which club has the highest total market value from left-footed players?
Analysis: Aggregate the total value of left-footed players per club and see which club has the highest sum.
Code Tip: Use groupby('club')['price'].sum() to get the total market value per club for left-footed players, and sort the values.

5. Do left-footed players tend to have higher or lower maximum prices than right-footed players?
Analysis: Compare the average max_price between left-footed and right-footed players.
Code Tip: Filter by foot preference ('Left' vs 'Right') and then compare the mean of max_price for both groups using a bar plot.

6. What is the height distribution of left-footed players?
Analysis: Plot a histogram or box plot of the heights of left-footed players.
Code Tip: Similar to age distribution, but focus on the height column for left-footed players only.

7. What is the average contract length for left-footed players?
Analysis: Calculate the average years remaining on contract for left-footed players based on contract_expires and joined_club.
Code Tip: Subtract the year of contract_expires from the current year to calculate contract length, then find the average.

8. Are left-footed players more likely to play in certain positions (e.g., wingers, strikers)?
Analysis: Investigate if left-footed players are more concentrated in specific positions like wingers or strikers.
Code Tip: Use value_counts() on the position column for left-footed players to see the frequency of positions.

9. Do left-footed players have higher or lower shirt numbers on average compared to right-footed players?
Analysis: Compare the average shirt number between left-footed and right-footed players.
Code Tip: Filter the dataset by foot preference and calculate the mean shirt_nr for each group.

10. Is there a notable difference in market price based on player agents for left-footed players?
Analysis: Examine whether certain player agents are associated with higher market values for left-footed players.
Code Tip: Group by player_agent and calculate the average price for each agent, then visualize the results with a bar plot.

These questions should give you a solid foundation for analyzing left-footed players in the Bundesliga dataset using pandas for data manipulation 
and matplotlib for visualizations. You can expand the analysis by adding more sophisticated charts (e.g., scatter plots, pair plots, etc.) 
or by diving deeper into specific aspects like performance or agent analysis.
