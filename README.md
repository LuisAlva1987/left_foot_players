For this project, I will analyze data from professional soccer players in the German Bundesliga, with a specific focus on left-footed players. The Bundesliga, founded in 1963, is Germany's premier professional football league, featuring 18 teams and operating under a promotion and relegation system.

The dataset under analysis provides a rich set of player attributes, including names, ages, heights, nationalities, places of birth, market values, maximum prices, positions, shirt numbers, preferred foot, current clubs, contract expiration dates, transfer dates, player agents, and outfitting brands. By investigating this dataset, I aim to uncover key insights and trends related to left-footed players in the league.

Analysis Goals:

This project I will use Python Pandas to answer the following analysis questions related to left-footed players in the Bundesliga:

* What is the age distribution of left-footed players?

* How does the market price compare for left-footed players across different positions?

* What is the relationship between age and price for left-footed players?

* Which club has the highest total market value from left-footed players?

* Do left-footed players tend to have higher or lower maximum prices than right-footed players?

* What is the height distribution of left-footed players?

* What is the average contract length for left-footed players?

* Are left-footed players more likely to play in certain positions (e.g., wingers, strikers)?

* Is there a notable difference in market price based on player agents for left-footed players?
